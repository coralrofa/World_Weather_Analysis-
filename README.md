## Overview
Data base WeatherPy_vacation.csv was generated to hold vacation destinations. Randomly generated geographical coordinates were used to retrieve weather data from OpenWeatherMap. City, Country, and hotel availability was retrieved using the Google Cloud platform. To guide selection of the desired vacation destination, an interface prompting for desired max/min temperatures allowed filtering of possible destinations and generation of a possible vacation itinerary.
